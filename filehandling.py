# we can read, write, open a path and basically play with various things like r,w,a and x here

# p=open('lists.py')

# print(p.read())

# r= open("ka_haal_baa.txt", 'w')
# r= open("ka_haal_baa.txt", 'a')
# r.write( "ab aimee agr mai append bhi krna chahu to ker skta hu babaua smjhe na 'a' ke help se purana wala delete nhe hota hai." )
# r.close()

# 'x' is used to create a file as well but it fails and an eroor occurs if the name of the file matches with some file previously created.
