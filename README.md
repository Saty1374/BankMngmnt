# Bank Management Project

Bank Management System is a Python-based project developed to simulate essential banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system enables users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check account balances, and manage customer details in an organized and efficient manner.

The project focuses on applying core Python fundamentals along with OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation to model real-world banking functionality. Emphasis has been placed on modular code design, logical flow, and clean structure to ensure readability and scalability.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly implementation that helps learners understand how banking systems can be represented programmatically. It is suitable for students and beginners looking to strengthen their Python skills while gaining practical exposure to object-oriented design and problem-solving techniques.
