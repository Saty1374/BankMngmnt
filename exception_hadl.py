# Exceptional handling is nothing but the exceptions that prevent the code from running due to a simple input value or something else.

# we use to handle the exceptions by the help of several handling techniques :
# 1. 
# a=int(input("ENter a number:"))
# try:
#     print(10/a)
# 2.
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("sorry you cant divide by 0")

# print("ok i have done the division")

# except Exception as err:
#     print(f"sorry you cant divide by 0 as the exception occurs as {err}")
